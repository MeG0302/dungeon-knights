# Run doc — Dungeon Knights (Next.js)

Thread workspace == main checkout: `D:\free buff\kiro edited\dungeon knights robinhood`

## 1. Reproduce the uncommitted artifacts

A fresh checkout needs these local-only pieces before it will run:

- **`.env.local`** — git-ignored, lives in the main checkout. Copy it, never symlink:
  `cp "<main checkout>/.env.local" .`
  (Next.js reads it automatically; the dev server log line `- Environments: .env.local` confirms it was picked up.)
- **Dependencies** — npm project (`package-lock.json` present): `npm ci` (or `npm install`).
  `node_modules/` is already present in this checkout.

Nothing else is required to boot. Note that the game engine scripts are served **verbatim** from
disk, not bundled:

- Root `dungeon.js`, `game.js`, `combat.js`, `characters.js`, … are the **source of truth** you edit.
- `public/` holds the copies the browser actually fetches (`/dungeon.js?v=…`).
- After editing a root engine file, sync it into `public/`:
  `cp dungeon.js game.js combat.js characters.js pathfinding.js dungeon-select.js dungeon-session.js public/`
  `public/dungeon.js` must be **byte-identical** to the root file — confirm with
  `diff dungeon.js public/dungeon.js` (empty output).

### Arya, the dungeon gate keeper

She is one shared popup, not four separate ones: `public/arya.js` defines
`window.Arya`, and `public/css/arya.css` styles her. Any page can call

```js
window.Arya.say('clear', { dungeon: 'Forgotten Crypts' });
// or 'enter' | 'mint' | 'return' | 'ready' | 'alarm' | 'brace' | 'think'
```

`window.Arya.say()` is wrapped in try/catch on purpose — she is decoration and must never
take down a page that called her (an early version threw straight out of the game's
dungeon-clear handler). She rises from the lower middle, auto-hides after 8s, dismisses on
click/Esc, and **steps aside when a dialog with buttons is open**, narrowing her bubble to
the gutter so that dialog stays clickable. She is seated above a page's own bottom bar
(`.control-bar`, `.dungeon-bottom`) and ignores pointer events except on her bubble.

| line | portrait | fires from |
|---|---|---|
| `clear` | `arya-clear.png` | root `game.js` `handleDungeonCleared()`; also the vault's last floor in `app/points/dungeon.js` |
| `enter` | `arya-enter.png` | `dungeon-select.js` accept handler (transition extended 1500 → 2200 ms for her screen time) |
| `mint` | `arya-mint.png` | `public/mint-page.js` `handleMint()` success (replaces the old `alert`) |
| `return` | `arya-return.png` | the game remembers the trip (`Arya.setFlag('fromGame')` on a click of `a[href="menu.html"]` or `#menuBtn`); `menu.js` consumes the flag on load |
| `ready` | `arya-ready.png` | `/points` wallet connect succeeded (replaced the `enter` battle-cry there — the helmet-and-shield portrait reads wrong for signing in) |
| `alarm` | `arya-alarm.png` | `/points` signature declined |
| `brace` | `arya-brace.png` | the walkthrough's vault and leaderboard steps |
| `think` | `arya-think.png` | the walkthrough's framing steps (and her fallback expression) |

- Art: `public/assets/arya/` — eight portraits renamed from the `arya/` folder in the
  project root, which is left untouched as the source. All have real alpha, so she needs no
  backing panel. The second batch (`ready`, `alarm`, `brace`, `think`) arrived with the
  walkthrough; `alarm` is the wide-eyed hands-up pose, `brace` the sword-and-shield scowl,
  `think` the chin-in-hand pose, `ready` the hand-on-hilt grin.
- The four legacy pages get the script from `lib/static-pages.js`; `/points` is a React
  route and pulls it in with `next/script` from `app/points/client.js`. **Bump `arya.js?v=` in
  both places after editing the module, and `arya.css?v=` after editing the CSS** (the module
  injects the stylesheet itself as a fallback for pages that only load the script).
- Each of the four portraits is 1.0–1.4 MB, so a page prefetches only the line it is most
  likely to need (`PAGE_DEFAULT` in the module maps `/game` and `/points` → `clear`,
  `/menu` → `return`, `/mint` → `mint`, `/dungeons` → `enter`); the others are fetched on
  first use and cached. Prefetching all four put ~4.8 MB on every page load.
- She only appears while the page is on screen, so a backgrounded preview shows nothing —
  that is the same rAF pause the vault has, not a bug.
- Measured pitfalls worth keeping fixed: the popup must be un-hidden **before** its bubble
  is measured (a hidden subtree reports width 0, which steered her with a bogus offset on
  every appearance after the first), and `say()` must stay wrapped in try/catch (an early
  version threw out of the game's own dungeon-clear handler).

#### The walkthrough (`window.Arya.tour`)

Newcomers get a guided tour of the Points Program on their first visit, and never again on
that browser. `app/points/client.js` supplies the steps (it is the only part that knows its
own DOM) and the module drives the rest:

```js
window.Arya.tour('points-v1', { steps: [{ kind, text, mood, target }], force });
window.Arya.hasSeenTour('points-v1');   // → localStorage `dk_arya_tour_points-v1`
window.Arya.forgetTour('points-v1');    // replay for the next visitor
```

- A step's `kind` may be a **function**, and its `text` a string or a function — the wallet
  step reads both live, so it is alarmed with no wallet, thoughtful while unsigned, sworn-in
  once bound, and its line names the address and rank.
- Each visit: the version that shipped this is `points-v1`; bump it to show the tour again.
- A step's `target` is a CSS selector. The module dims the whole page with a single fixed
  box carrying a 9999px spread shadow (`#arya-spot`, z-index 1150, below her 1200) and rings
  the target — and **steps her aside** when her bubble would sit on top of it
  (`seatForStep()`; the Points page's share and referral rows are under her, the leaderboard
  is beside her). She is measured from a centred bubble first, or step 2 would be judged from
  where step 1 pushed her.
- While a tour runs her bubble **does not auto-hide** and `say()` is ignored, so a page event
  (connecting mid-tour fires one) cannot stomp the step being read. Esc, **Skip**, and
  finishing all mark it seen; **entering the vault ends it** (`endTour()` in
  `handleEnterDungeon`), because the vault covers the page.
- The footer's **Ask Arya** chip replays it on demand (`force: true`).
- Verify from a console: `window.Arya.forgetTour('points-v1')`, reload, and the tour starts
  ~1 s after the page settles. `tools/check-all.js`'s battery also covers her plain popups
  (29 checks) — run it with the tour stopped, since it drives `say()` directly.

### The map loading gate (`public/loading-gate.js`)

`/game` used to open on the wrong map: the page markup carried a hard-coded crypts
background video and a crypts chest in the side panel, so a player who chose Void Rift saw
Crypts paint first and then snap away — and the chosen map then drew in front of an empty
floor while its monster art, knight sprites and obstacle tiles were still on the wire.

Now the game page's own markup carries an opaque gate (`#mapLoadingGate`, styles in
`theme.css`, z-index 1900) that covers all of it from the first paint, and
`loading-gate.js` — the **first** script in the page's list — takes it down only once the
chosen dungeon's art has settled. Arya stands on the gate at z-index 2200 saying `hold`
("the map is still coming through the gate"), and the module takes her down with it.

- What it waits for: the dungeon's floor tile, decoration sheet and chest; every monster it
  can spawn; the knight sprites for **the rarities in this squad**; the obstacle art the
  renderer allocates on its first frame (that is what used to pop in after the map appeared);
  and the map video's first frame (`readyState >= 2`).
- It can never trap the player: an image that is already complete or that fails counts as
  settled, and the failsafe opens the gate at **15 s** regardless (`console.warn` says so).
  It holds for a minimum of 900 ms so a fully cached load does not flash.
- The page markup must keep its **empty** `<source type="video/mp4">`: the engine sets the
  real video in `switchDungeonVideo()`, and re-adding a hard-coded crypts source brings the
  flash (and a multi-MB download of a map the player did not choose) straight back.
- Verification is `node tools/gate-check.js` — 22 checks against a stub DOM and stub timers,
  because a real local load finishes in under two seconds and is nearly impossible to catch
  mid-flight by hand. It covers the wait list, one-asset-left, failed art, the once-only
  open, a page with no gate, and the failsafe.

**Related: the renderer no longer preloads art it cannot draw.** `DungeonRenderer` used to
fetch every dungeon's chest (~13 MB of PNG at ~2.6 MB each) and all six knight tiers (~9 MB)
on every load, competing with the art the gate is waiting for. It now loads the chosen
dungeon's chest and the squad's tiers (`squadKnightTiers()`), with `chestImageFor()` /
`knightImageFor()` fetching anything else lazily, so a missing entry can never draw blank.
Measured on a Void Rift load: **1 chest fetched instead of 5, 3 knight sprites instead of 6,
and only the void map video.**

### The Points Vault is not an engine dungeon

It is a scripted mini-game on the Points Program page (`app/points/`), reachable only from that
page's **Enter Vault** button — it is deliberately absent from `DUNGEONS`, the quest board and the
random rotation, because as an engine dungeon it would make every `/game` load preload ~7 MB of
vault monster art no dungeon could ever show. Its React sources need no `public/` copy, but its
stylesheet does:

- `public/css/points.css` — served verbatim, and the page links it as `/css/points.css?v=N`.
  **Bump that `?v=` in `app/points/client.js` after editing the CSS**, or the browser keeps serving
  the old file and the vault renders unstyled.
- Vault art lives in `public/assets/points/` (map video `background.mp4`, `dummy-knight.png`,
  `monster-1..3.png`, `chest.png`).
### The Points Program is server-backed

Points are no longer `localStorage`. `lib/points.js` (the old browser-only module) is **deleted**;
the rules now live in `lib/points-config.js` (the table: 100/300/500, 15%/5% commissions) and
`lib/points-program.js` (the rules: what a floor pays, once a day, in order, plus commissions).
The browser asks; it never decides.

- **Storage** — `lib/points-store.js`, two drivers chosen by environment:
  - *file* (default in dev): `.data/points.json`, which is **gitignored**. To start fresh,
    delete it **and restart the server** — the running process caches the file in memory, so
    deleting it underneath a live server does nothing until the next cold start.
  - *redis* (Upstash-compatible REST): set `KV_REST_API_URL` + `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, or
    `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. Production falls back to in-memory
    when neither is set, which loses points on redeploy and warns loudly on every write.
- **Sessions** — `lib/points-session.js`. The wallet signs a nonce challenge
  (`personal_sign`), `ethers.verifyMessage` recovers the signer, and the API returns an
  HMAC-signed token the page keeps in `localStorage.dk_points_session` for 30 days. Set
  `POINTS_SESSION_SECRET` in production; without it a random per-process secret is used, which
  still works but signs everyone out on each cold start.
- **Endpoints** (all `app/api/points/…`, `force-dynamic`, node runtime):

  | route | method | purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | `/session` | `GET ?address=` / `POST` | the message to sign / exchange a signature for a token |
  | `/me` | `GET` / `POST {ref}` | the page's state / claim a referral code |
  | `/vault` | `POST {action}` | `clear` a floor, or `share` for the ×2 bonus — **the only way points are awarded** |
  | `/leaderboard` | `GET ?limit=` | the public board (`isYou` when a token is sent) |

- Wallet connection is `lib/points-client.js`, deliberately **not** `public/wallet.js`: the
  React route does not load the legacy script stack. It talks to `window.ethereum` and writes
  the same `walletConnected` / `walletAddress` keys the legacy pages use, so one connect serves
  the whole site. Wallet detection happens in an effect (plus `focus` and
  `ethereum#initialized`) so a late-injecting wallet does not leave the button dead.
- Old localStorage keys (`dk_points`, `dk_vault_levels`, `dk_vault_share`,
  `dk_all_wallet_points`) are dead but may still be in a browser profile from earlier runs;
  nothing reads or writes them any more.
- `tools/check-all.js` is the verification battery for everything in this thread. It is
  outside `public/`, so serve it temporarily to use it:

  ```bash
  cp tools/check-all.js public/_check.js
  # then, in the page console:
  #   await import('/_check.js?v=' + Date.now());
  #   window.__check.arya()        // 29 popup checks: structure, dedupe, swap, Esc,
  #                                // close button, auto-hide, dialog geometry
  #   window.__check.engine(8)     // main engine: runs, kills, chests static, counters
  #   window.__check.assets()      // which portraits this page actually fetched
  #   window.__check.clearWatch()  // then watch for a real dungeon clear + her line
  #   window.__check.vaultEntry(1) // play a whole vault entry, per-floor metrics    #   window.__check.report()      // { total, failed, failures[], results[] }
    rm public/_check.js            # and take it out again
    ```

  `node tools/gate-check.js` is the other half: it is a plain node test (no browser, no
  dependencies) for the map loading gate, and it exits non-zero on failure.

  Three constraints it encodes, all learned the hard way:

  1. **One entry per wallet per day is now a server rule**, so a soak run needs a fresh wallet
     per entry. The harness mints one itself — it loads `/ethers-5.7.2.umd.min.js`, keeps a key
     in `localStorage.__checkPk`, installs a mock `window.ethereum` that signs the page's own
     challenge, and clicks through the real connect button:

     ```js
     await window.__check.newWallet();   // fresh key + mock provider (idempotent)
     await window.__check.signIn();      // drives the page's Connect flow for real
     window.__check.vaultEntry(1);       // one entry; run newWallet() again for the next
     window.__check.me();                // the server's view of this wallet
     ```

     `vaultEntry` refuses to start on a spent wallet and says so instead of spinning.
  2. The vault can only be replayed on a **freshly loaded** `/points`, and `vaultEntry` reads
     the payout from `GET /api/points/me` rather than from a counter.
  3. Arya's own cooldown means a test that calls the same line twice has to wait it out. Vault
     entries are persisted to `localStorage.dk_check_runs`, so they survive the reload between
     them.

- `tools/vault-soak.js` is a dev-only soak harness: paste it into the console on `/points`
  (it is outside `public/`, so the browser cannot fetch it) and it plays whole entries on its
  own — plain, shared on X, and one with a mid-floor Exit — checking payouts, sprite overlap,
  bounds and effect-array growth. Read `window.__soak.summary()`, stop with `window.__soak.stop()`.
  It polls `GET /api/points/me` on every tick and settles each payout once the server has
  answered, so its numbers come from the API, not from a local counter. It stops after the
  wallet's entry for the day (see constraint 1 above) rather than complaining forever about a
  locked **Vault Cleared Today** button.
- The vault's clock is driven by `requestAnimationFrame`, so it **pauses while the tab is not
  being composited** (backgrounded, occluded, or a preview surface with no visible client).
  That is intentional — no dungeon time is lost — but it means a headless soak only progresses
  while the page is actually being rendered.

## 2. Run the server

- Script: `npm run dev` (`next dev`).
- **Port:** this environment exports `PORT=0`, which makes Next allocate a random free port on
  every start. Port 3000 is free and is the project default, so pin it for a stable URL:

  ```powershell
  powershell -NoProfile -Command '$env:PORT="3000"; (Start-Process -FilePath "npm.cmd" -ArgumentList "run","dev" -RedirectStandardOutput "<log>" -RedirectStandardError "<log>.err" -WindowStyle Hidden -PassThru).Id'
  ```

  Start-Process must name the executable exactly (`npm.cmd`, not `npm`); stdout and stderr need
  **different** files. The command may appear to hang the calling shell — the detached server is
  fine; confirm it instead of retrying:

  ```bash
  powershell -NoProfile -Command "if (Get-Process -Id <pid> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { 'pid alive' } else { 'pid DEAD' }"
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" --max-time 20 http://localhost:3000/
  ```

- **Do not run `npm run build` while the dev server is up** — it overwrites `.next/`, and the dev
  server then 404s its own chunks (`/_next/static/chunks/...`). Restart it after any build.
- Then register the preview: `register_preview` with `url: http://localhost:3000` and the
  listener pid from `netstat -ano | grep LISTENING | grep ":3000"`.

## 3. Deploying to Vercel (production)

The project deploys with the **CLI**, not a git integration: `vercel ls` shows deployments
authored by `meglast320-1694`, and a `git push` does not trigger a build. From this worktree:

```bash
vercel --prod --yes
vercel alias set <the-new-deployment-url> dungeon-knights.vercel.app
```

**The second command is not optional.** `--prod` publishes to and aliases
dungeon-knights-meglast320-1694.vercel.app, and leaves the project's custom domain
`dungeon-knights.vercel.app` pointing at whatever it pointed at before — so a successful deploy
is invisible at the URL people actually open. Always re-alias, then verify the *custom* domain,
not the deployment URL.

### Environment variables (production)

`vercel env ls production` is the source of truth; env changes need a **redeploy** to apply.

| variable | why it is required |
|---|---|
| `POINTS_SESSION_SECRET` | **Set.** Sessions are HMACs. Without it each serverless instance generates its own random secret, so a token minted by one instance is rejected by the next: a player connects, clears a floor, and is randomly logged out. Measured before/after: 1-of-8 authenticated calls succeeded, then 8-of-8 once set. |
| `KV_REST_API_URL` + `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` (or `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`) | **NOT set — required before the Points Program means anything.** Without it the store falls back to per-instance memory. |

Without a shared store the once-per-day rule is enforced **per instance**, so under concurrent
traffic the numbers go wrong in exactly the way a rewards program must not. Measured on a
production deployment with no KV, same wallet, same day:

```
sequential: floor 1 credited 100 PTS
ten concurrent balance reads -> 100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100   (inconsistent)
six concurrent re-clears of the SAME floor -> credited 100, 100, 100, 0, 100, 0  (paid 5x)
```

That is why the page reports the driver and shows an amber banner when `persistent` is false.
Provisioning a store needs the account owner: `vercel integration add` requires an interactive
terminal and a human accepting marketplace terms.

**Decision taken in this thread (user, explicit): production stays on the in-memory store for
now.** Do not provision KV, and do not add a fail-closed guard, without asking again. The amber
banner is the intended signal, and a single player clicking through the vault is sequential
traffic — which is why their own run will usually look correct while a crowd would not.

### `.vercelignore` — anchor every root-only path

Patterns are gitignore-style, so an unanchored `points/` also matches `app/points/`,
`app/api/points/` and `public/assets/points/`. That shipped a deployment which **built green and
had no Points Program at all**: `/points` 404'd and the vault had no art, while the build log
looked perfect. Only `/art/`, `/arya/`, `/points/`, `/tools/`, `/docs/` are excluded, all anchored.

Quick post-deploy check that catches that class of failure:

```bash
for p in / /points /menu /mint /dungeons /game \
         "/api/points/session?address=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111" \
         /assets/points/background.mp4 /css/points.css /sprites/manifest.json; do
  printf '%-70s %s\n' "$p" "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "https://dungeon-knights.vercel.app$p")"
done
```

### Watching the game

`/game` redirects to `/menu` unless a squad is selected (`localStorage.selectedKnights`). To drive
it headlessly, seed a squad and click DEPLOY:

```js
const L = { name:'Legendary', multiplier:15.0, color:'#FFD700', tier:'LEGENDARY', dropRate:0.01, dungeonReward:150, dailyRuns:4 };
localStorage.setItem('selectedKnights', JSON.stringify(
  [1,2,3,4,5].map(i => ({ id: 500+i, rarity: L,
    stats: { power:250, range:1, speed:15, maxStamina:6000, recoveryRate:90 },
    stamina:6000, state:'idle', totalEarned:0 }))));
```

Freezing the animation loop for a screenshot breaks the rAF chain — restore it with
`game.gameLoop = game.constructor.prototype.gameLoop` and re-kick
`requestAnimationFrame(t => game.gameLoop(t))`, or the game stays frozen forever.
